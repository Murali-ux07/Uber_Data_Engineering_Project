# Uber Data Engineering & Analytics Project

## Description

This Uber Data Engineering project is designed to showcase a full-fledged data pipeline and analytics solution for ride-hailing trip data. The project transforms raw Uber trip records into a structured Data Warehouse built on a star schema model, enabling efficient querying and insightful business analytics.

The core motivation is to demonstrate practical skills in:

- Extracting and transforming messy real-world data into clean, consistent schemas.
- Designing dimensional models to simplify complex data relationships for analytical queries.
- Effectively loading and managing large datasets in PostgreSQL.
- Creating dynamic and interactive dashboards with Power BI that drive data-driven decision-making.

This project reflects key concepts and best practices relevant to modern data engineering, including:

- ETL automation potential through Python and SQL.
- Data quality and integrity via primary keys and foreign key constraints.
- Analytical readiness with pre-aggregated dimensions and facts.
- Visualization best practices for operational and strategic insights.

Whether you are a data engineering enthusiast, aspiring analyst, or developer keen on trucking, scaling, and analyzing big data pipelines, this project provides a comprehensive learning and showcase platform.

## Overview
This project demonstrates building a scalable data pipeline for Uber trip data, transforming raw datasets into a structured Data Warehouse (Star Schema), and creating dashboards for insightful analytics. The pipeline involves data extraction, cleaning, dimensional modeling, and visualization using Power BI.

---

## Objectives
- Build a robust ETL pipeline to process Uber trip data.
- Design a star schema Data Warehouse with facts and dimensions.
- Populate PostgreSQL tables efficiently.
- Develop interactive dashboards for operational and strategic insights.
- Automate & document the entire process for repeatable deployment.

---

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, SQLAlchemy)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- Power BI (Visualization)
- Git & GitHub for version control and sharing.

---

## Data Workflow Steps
1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Load raw Uber trip CSV data.
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**:
   - Rename columns (align with schema).
   - Handle missing values & duplicates.
   - Extract date/time components.
3. **Dimensional Design**:
   - Create dimension tables (passenger count, trip distance, rate code, payment type, locations, datetime).
   - Surrogate key assignment.
4. **Fact Table Creation**:
   - Populate fact table with foreign keys referencing dimension tables.
   - Store measures like fare, tip, total amount.
5. **Load into PostgreSQL**:
   - Bulk insert CSVs into existing tables.
6. **Build Visualizations**:
   - Use Power BI for interactive dashboards on trip patterns, revenue, geographic insights, and customer behavior.
